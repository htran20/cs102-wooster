# cs102-wooster
Attempting to make JES media.py functions work in Python 3 without Java.  This codebase is used in CS 102: Multimedia Computing at The College of Wooster.

This code depends on PyQt4 and PIL/pillow.  It uses PyQt4 instead of PyQt5 because we run the code in Enthought Canopy in our course.  Canopy currently has PyQt4 in its package manager, but it does not have PyQt5 yet.
